## How to Play

- The game board has 7 columns and 6 rows.
- Players take turns clicking on a column to drop their colored disc (Red or Yellow).
- The disc will occupy the lowest available empty spot in that column.
- The first player to connect 4 discs vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game.
- If the board fills up without any player winning, the game will end in a draw.

## How to Run

2. Click on the columns to place your discs.
3. Play until a player wins or the game is a draw.
